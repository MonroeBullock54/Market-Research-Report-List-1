<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Co-oximetry Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Transmission Type</li><li>Reflectance Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Co-oximetry market comprises two main types: transmission and reflectance. Transmission co-oximetry involves measuring light absorption through a blood sample, typically using cuvettes, to determine oxygen and hemoglobin levels. Reflectance co-oximetry, on the other hand, utilizes light reflected from the skin or tissue surface to assess blood properties non-invasively. Each type offers distinct advantages, with transmission being more accurate in clinical settings, while reflectance is often preferred for its convenience and ease of use in point-of-care applications.</p></p>
