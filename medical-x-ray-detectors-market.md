<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Medical X-Ray Detectors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Indirect Conversion</li><li>Direct Conversion</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The medical X-ray detectors market is primarily divided into two types: indirect conversion and direct conversion detectors. Indirect conversion detectors utilize a two-step process where X-rays are first converted into light, which is then transformed into an electrical signal. This method often employs materials like scintillators. In contrast, direct conversion detectors convert X-rays directly into electrical signals using materials such as amorphous selenium, resulting in higher image quality and efficiency. Both types are essential for diagnostic imaging and patient care.</p></p>
