<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Public Access Defibrillator (PAD) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Semi-automated</li><li>Fully automated</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Public Access Defibrillator (PAD) market comprises two main types: semi-automated and fully automated defibrillators. Semi-automated devices require some input from the user, such as placing pads on the patient and initiating shock delivery once the device advises it. In contrast, fully automated defibrillators provide a more user-friendly experience, autonomously assessing the patient's condition and delivering shocks without any manual intervention. Both types aim to enhance emergency response capabilities in public settings, ultimately increasing survival rates during cardiac emergencies.</p></p>
