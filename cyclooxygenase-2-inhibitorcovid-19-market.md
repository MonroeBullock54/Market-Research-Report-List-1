<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cyclooxygenase 2 InhibitorCOVID 19 Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Selective Cox 2 Inhibitor</li><li>Non-Selective Cox 2 Inhibitor</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) inhibitor market for COVID-19 includes selective and non-selective COX-2 inhibitors. Selective COX-2 inhibitors specifically target the COX-2 enzyme, potentially reducing inflammation and pain with fewer gastrointestinal side effects. Non-selective COX-2 inhibitors, on the other hand, inhibit both COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes, providing broader anti-inflammatory effects but may lead to more gastrointestinal complications. Both types are being investigated for their potential roles in managing COVID-19 symptoms and inflammation.</p></p>
