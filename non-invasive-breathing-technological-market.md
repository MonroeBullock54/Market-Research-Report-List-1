<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Non-invasive Breathing Technological Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Positive-pressure</li><li>Negative-pressure</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The non-invasive breathing technology market is primarily divided into positive-pressure and negative-pressure systems. Positive-pressure devices, such as CPAP machines, deliver airflow directly into the airway, enhancing ventilation and oxygenation for patients with conditions like sleep apnea or respiratory distress. In contrast, negative-pressure technologies, like chest wall oscillation systems, create a vacuum effect that aids in respiratory function by promoting lung expansion. Both types effectively support patients without requiring invasive procedures, catering to various respiratory needs and preferences.</p></p>
